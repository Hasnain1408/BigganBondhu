      <h1>Nuclear Reactions</h1>
      <p>
        Nuclear reactions involve changes in an atom's nucleus and can release enormous amounts of energy. Unlike chemical reactions, which involve electron transfer, nuclear reactions alter the number of protons or neutrons in a nucleus, changing one element into another.
      </p>
      <h2>Types of Nuclear Reactions</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Fission:</strong> A heavy nucleus splits into two smaller nuclei, releasing energy and neutrons. Example: Uranium-235 splitting in a reactor.</li>
        <li><strong>Fusion:</strong> Two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. Fusion powers the Sun and hydrogen bombs.</li>
        <li><strong>Capture Reactions:</strong> A nucleus absorbs a particle (like a neutron), often becoming unstable and undergoing further decay.</li>
        <li><strong>Decay Reactions:</strong> Spontaneous transformation of an unstable nucleus (e.g., alpha, beta decay).</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Mass-Energy Equivalence</h2>
      <p>
        Einstein's equation E = mcÂ² explains how a small loss in mass during nuclear reactions translates into large energy releases. This principle is foundational in both nuclear power and weapons.
      </p>
      <h2>Applications</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Nuclear Power:</strong> Controlled fission reactions generate electricity in nuclear power plants.</li>
        <li><strong>Medical Isotopes:</strong> Produced using nuclear reactions for diagnosis and treatment.</li>
        <li><strong>Fusion Research:</strong> Projects like ITER aim to achieve sustainable fusion energy.</li>
      </ul>
